      <p>This project is an ad for the band Linkin Park's latest single release, "Lost." I wanted <br>
        to focus on how we as humans go through hardships in life and how life can be challenging in <br>
        general. A lot of their music talks about dealing with life, the pain we experience, and bottling <br>
        up our emotions. I think that if some people give their music a listen, it could really benefit them <br>
        due to the messages expressed in their music, especially if that said person is going through a tough <br>
        time in their life.</p>
